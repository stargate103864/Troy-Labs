/**
 * Note: You'll use this file to create some data files for your lab.
 *       You just need to change the NUM_STUDENTS constant to the number of
 *       student records you want created in the file - all else will be taken
 *       care of for you.
 *       Keep in mind, as you create larger and larger data sets, your account
 *       will fill up fast. For example, I created a 500,000 record file and the
 *       file size was 10.4Mb! (there are about 21 characters/bytes per record -
 *       so 21 * 500,000 is about 10,000,000 bytes.
